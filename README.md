Problem Set 4 - solved
This programs were written and submitted by Diego Baños Salavarría
They were finished on October 10th 2019 for Audio Programming in C with Akito van Troyer 
Due date: October 18th at 12:00 a.m. 
Files included:4.1.c, 4.2.c and 4.3.c 
4.2 was giving me a hard time because I wasn't counting '\n' as a character. Code would always delete that '\n', so it seemed as if didn't work correctly.
